ðŸ“Š Market Sentiment Trading Analysis

This project looks at how **market sentiment** (Fear & Greed Index) affects trading results.

We use:
- `historical_data.csv` â†’ past trades (PnL, volume, accounts, etc.)
- `fear_greed_index.csv` â†’ market sentiment per day

We merge them and check:
- Win rate by sentiment
- Profitability by sentiment
- Trading volume by sentiment
- Account bias vs profitability

ðŸ“‚ Files in This Project
- `historical_data.csv` â†’ trade history
- `fear_greed_index.csv` â†’ daily fear/greed index
- `analysis.py` â†’ Python code for cleaning, merging, and plotting
- `win_rate_by_market_sentiments.png` â†’ Win rate chart
- `net_pnl_by_market_sentiments.png` â†’ Net PnL chart
- `volume_by_market_sentiments.png` â†’ Trading volume chart
- `Account_sentiment_bias_vs_profitability.png` â†’ Account scatter plot
- `REPORT.md` â†’ Simple report with findings (like explained to a 15-year-old)

ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python analysis.py
Check the generated charts and report.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
Greed = higher win rate
Fear = more total profit
Extreme fear = really bad results
Bias (buying in greed, selling in fear) doesnâ€™t always help

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal is to help traders see how emotions and market mood affect performance.

Market Sentiment Trading Analysis

This project looks at how market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) affects trading results.

We use:

historical_data.csv → past trades (PnL, volume, accounts, etc.)
fear_greed_index.csv → market sentiment per day
We merge them and check:

Win rate by sentiment
Profitability by sentiment
Trading volume by sentiment
Account bias vs profitability
